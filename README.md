# 3D Vector Rotation and Transformation Demonstrations

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate the process of rotating 3D vectors using rotation matrices. The scripts utilize the `numpy` library to perform matrix operations and showcase how vectors transform when they are rotated about the x-axis in a three-dimensional space.

## What's Inside

- `changing_multiple_rotations.py`:
- `single_axis_dcm.py`:

## Future Updates

As time progresses, I will be adding more scripts and examples that cover:
- Rotations around the y-axis and z-axis.
- Combinations of rotations around multiple axes.
- More complex transformations and their applications.

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to contribute or use these demonstrations as a learning resource or a starting point for your own projects!
